# Holidays and Business Days

This short and dirty version will return a list of all holidays included in a configuration file
or, provided a specific date, return the next business day taking into account weekends and the
holidays included in the configuration file.

Possible improvements:
* Store holidays in a database
* Build a UI to manage the holidays
* Replace the list with a programmatic solution to calculating holidays
* Scrape the holidays from the NYSE and Fed websites
